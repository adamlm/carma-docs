## CARMA Platform

CARMA is a reusable, extensible platform for controlling SAE level 2 connected, automated vehicles (AVs). It provides a
rich, generic API for third party plugins that implement vehicle guidance algorithms to plan vehicle trajectories. It
is written in C++ and runs in a Robot Operating System (ROS) environment on Ubuntu. The platform can be reused on a
variety of properly equipped vehicles.

## CARMA Streets

CARMA Streets is a component of CARMA ecosystem, which enables such a coordination among different transportation
users. This component provides an interface for CDA participants to interact with the road infrastructure. CARMA
Streets is also an edge-computing unit that improves the efficiency and performance of the Transportation Systems
Management and Operations (TSMO) strategies.

## CARMA Cloud

CARMAcloud provides some of the infrastructure components for CARMA. It enables users to define geofences, rules of
practice, replay storms to test weather-related rules of practice, as well as monitor CARMA-enabled vehicles and the
messages and controls exchanged with them.

## CARMA Messenger

CARMA Messenger is a standalone research platform which is aimed to deploy on non-automated entities who participate in
the transportation system, including first responders, transit vehicles, law enforcement vehicles, and pedestrians. It
helps other vehicles or travelers communicate with CARMA Platform vehicles, sharing information and performing
cooperative operations to improve transportation efficiency and safety.
